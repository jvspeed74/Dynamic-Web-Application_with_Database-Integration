# Draft 2
Serves as a branching point for the next submission deadline. There are several branches that need to be completed for this build.

# Branching Strategy:
- "Main" branch for production-ready code AKA if you THINK there's an issue with your code DO NOT PUSH IT HERE.
- "Draft 2" branch is for new features, bug fixes, and minor adjustments.

Getting Started:
- Download GitHub Desktop
- Using GitHub Desktop, open project branches in PHPStorm.
- If you try to open project in PHPStorm without going through GitHub Desktop, you make have issues.

Regular Commits:
- Encourage regular, small commits with clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Each commit should represent a logical change, making it easier to understand the project's history.

Pull Requests:
- Create pull requests (PRs) for each feature or bug fix that you are ready to upload. PRs allow team members to review code before merging it into the main branch.
- Use the PR discussion to communicate and resolve any issues or concerns.
