# I210SharedProject
This Project creates a website with the intention of implementing several backend techniques such as DBMS, SQL, and Application State.

Repository Setup:
- Ensure Git is downloaded.
- In PhpStorm: Settings->Version Control->GitHub->Login
- After logging in, go to top left of PhpStorm and click where it says "Version Control"
- Click create repository and use the url of this repository so it can clone it to your device.
- Once finished downloading, you're good to go and are connected.

Branching Strategy:
- "Master" branch for production-ready code AKA if you THINK there's an issue with your code DO NOT PUSH IT HERE.
- "Main" branch is for new features, bug fixes, and minor adjustments.

Regular Commits:
- Encourage regular, small commits with clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Each commit should represent a logical change, making it easier to understand the project's history.

Pull Requests:
- Create pull requests (PRs) for each feature or bug fix. PRs allow team members to review code before merging it into the main branch.
- Use the PR discussion to communicate and resolve any issues or concerns.

Code Reviews:
- Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality, adherence to coding standards, and knowledge sharing within the team.
- Provide constructive feedback during code reviews.
  
Collaboration:
- GitHub issues can be used for tracking tasks and bugs.
- Use project boards to organize and prioritize tasks.
- 
Backups:
- Regularly backup your database and store it securely. This is important when using tools like phpMyAdmin for database management.
