# I210SharedProject
This Project creates a website with the intention of implementing several backend techniques such as DBMS, SQL, and Application State.

Getting Started:
- Download GitHub Desktop

Branching Strategy:
- "Main" branch for production-ready code AKA if you THINK there's an issue with your code DO NOT PUSH IT HERE.
- "Main" branch is for new features, bug fixes, and minor adjustments.

Regular Commits:
- Encourage regular, small commits with clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Each commit should represent a logical change, making it easier to understand the project's history.

Pull Requests:
- Create pull requests (PRs) for each feature or bug fix that you are ready to upload. PRs allow team members to review code before merging it into the main branch.
- Use the PR discussion to communicate and resolve any issues or concerns.
